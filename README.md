# CS2235-HW2
Using the CreditCard class:
a. Modify the CreditCard class to include a method that
changes the account number. Demonstrate your
method works by changing the account number of the
California Savings card, wallet[0], to 0000-1111-2222-
3333 and printing the new number.
Note: This class treats the account number as a String
in the format “0000-0000-0000-0000”. Use this format
when demonstrating your change.
Hint: Use
wallet[0].yourMethod(yourNewAccountNumber) to
change the limit and wallet[0].getAccount() to print it.
b. Modify the CreditCard class so that it ignores any
request to process a negative payment amount and
informs the user of an invalid payment amount. Test
your modification by attempting a payment of -100 to
any of the three cards using the makePayment
method.
